          <div class="content-paragraph">
          <div class="first-paragraph">While I was sitting on a long yellow horizontal chair outside Lazer Blaster’s lobby in Star City, accompanying all the bags of all my classmates that had gone inside the famous attraction, a tough-looking man approached me. He was walking towards me from the counter before the door where my classmates had gone to. He was wearing a deep-blue colored uniform of what seemed to be more formal compared to what his colleagues were wearing. When his towering height appeared before me as I sat on one of the long chairs, he asked me why I was alone there along with dozens of different bags surrounding me. I said, I’m waiting for my classmates to go back from playing laser guns inside the attraction. “Come with me.” he said, and turned backwards. He must have sensed that I’m not coming after him. In my brain were thoughts, fighting, as to what I should do. I couldn’t just leave my classmate’s belongings, while I’m curious as to what he meant by saying the words, “come with me,” while facing the counter before the door. Finally, he turned back facing me and grabbed some of the bags that he can carry and walked towards the counter which I followed afterwards as I’m aware he meant no harm. He instructed me to put all the bags near the counter where he put the other bags. A woman of a similar uniform was standing near the counter while doing some work. She’s probably his colleague and is the person in charge of the belongings in the counter. The man told me to come near him where I was slowly being surprised while walking as he pulled a vest from the cabinet along with a laser gun. He placed the vest on my torso and tightened it with a belt. I told him that the reason why I’m waiting for my classmates in the lobby was that I don’t have enough money to pay for the game. He told me that I don’t have to pay for it and that he’s the manager of the attraction. I was a bit teary back then. I thanked him with all I’ve got for he smiled back at me with emotional eyes and advised me to go play with my friends inside the attraction as if I’m his son. As the woman from the counter opened the door leading to the game, she smiled before me, the kind of smile when someone is glad that they’re able to help someone.<br>
          <br>I was amazed by how the game looked on the inside. Black walls, black ceiling, and black floor surrounding the entire place that looked like a nightmare that has been given life by colors. Different variants of color sparked here and there, like that of a rainbow that suddenly appeared and I’m in awe of its vibrant color, staring at it for seconds. The lights were coming from the player’s guns, vests, and obstacles, giving the black space its current color. It was mesmerizing, I could never forget that moment. I laser shot one of my classmates while I was still outside the game, might be due to excitement. He hid in one of the obstacles with colorful lights in it as I rushed towards him. He asked me what was I doing inside and how did I came in. I told him everything and he told me how great it was that the manager let me in and have fun with them. It was the best day of my life, I told myself that day. And that I would cherish the opportunity to play this game along with my friends.<br>
          <br>As soon as we came out of the door through the exit, I looked for the man to thank him once again, but he’s nowhere to be found.<br>
          <br>This happened during our field trip as a third year in high school, and now that I’m 24, I kept wondering if the manager is still working at that attraction. How time flies so fast. I don’t think I can remember him if I had the chance to meet him again. Though I’m thinking of visiting that place again, maybe, once this pandemic ends. Soon, I hope.
